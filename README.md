Prerequisite(s): <br>
(i) All deployments are based on OCP/K8s based and hence you need clusters, tons of cluster Lol <br>
(ii) Install RH-OSSM on 5G Core Clusters so you can perform Federated Mesh among them.  <br>
(iii) Follow number flow scripts with assumption that you exported your KUBECONFIG already in that commandline window.  <br>
